# pokemongame
Pokémon game created my freshman year of high school.

This Pokémon project was initiated during my freshman year of high school in 2019, representing an early stage in my coding journey. At that time, I was still in the process of grasping various programming concepts and best practices. As a result, the codebase may reflect a limited understanding of certain programming principles.

Please be aware that this project might contain code that doesn't adhere to the standards I would follow today. It serves as a valuable artifact showcasing my growth and progression as a developer. I have chosen to keep this project accessible on GitHub to illustrate the learning journey from my early coding endeavors to my current skill level.

As a continuous learner, I appreciate any feedback or constructive criticism you may have. Feel free to reach out with suggestions or insights that could contribute to the improvement of this project.

Thank you for your understanding and for exploring this early piece of my coding history!
